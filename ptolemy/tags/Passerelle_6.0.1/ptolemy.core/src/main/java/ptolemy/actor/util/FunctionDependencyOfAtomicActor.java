/**
 An instance of this class describes the dependency that data at an output port
 has on data at an input port in a firing of the container (an atomic actor).
 In particular, an output port does not depend on an input port if the fire() method
 of the container produces outputs on the output port or asserts that no outputs
 will be produced on the output port in this iteration
 without knowing anything about the input port (what data are there,
 or even whether there are data). An actor that has one or more output ports that does
 not depend on one or more input ports is said to be non-strict.
 <p>
 By default, each output port of an atomic actor depends on all input
 ports of the actor. To change this, an actor should
 override the pruneDependencies() method of
 AtomicActor to remove dependencies between these ports.
 For example, {@link ptolemy.domains.de.lib.TimedDelay}
 declares that its <i>output</i> port is not dependent of its <i>input</i>
 port by defining this method:
 <pre>
 public void pruneDependencies() {
 super.pruneDependencies();
 removeDependency(input, output);
 }
 </pre>
