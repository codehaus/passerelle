/**
 A scheduler for the FixedPointDirector.  This scheduler constructs
 a static schedule for a model by performing a topological sort on the port
 dependency graph of that model.  The schedule may mention an actor more
 than once if the dependencies require it.
 <p>
 FIXME: This scheduler is currently very inefficient.  An actor will
 be mentioned in the schedule as many times as it has ports. E.g., if
 it has three ports, it will appear in the schedule three times.
 Some of these appearances in the schedule will be redundant (e.g.,
 a firing will occur after another firing even though
 there is no new information at the input ports), and
 some could be postponed and consolidated with a later appearance.
 Conjecture: The optimal schedule fires every actor as late
 as possible, i.e. not before the firing is essential for the
 schedule to proceed. This seems to be what the DE run-time
 scheduler does.  Another way to state this is that the actor
 should not be fired until there is no other actor firing possible
 that could provide it with new information. Note that a firing
 of an actor can provide new information to itself, if there
 is a self loop from one of its output ports to an input port.
