/**
 This is an abstract base class that
 describes the dependency that data at an output port
 has on data at an input port in a firing of the container, which is an entity.
 In particular, an output port does not depend on an input port if the fire() method
 of the container produces outputs on the output port or asserts that no outputs
 will be produced on the output port in this iteration
 without knowing anything about the input port (what data are there,
 or even whether there are data).
 The container is specified by the constructor argument and cannot be changed
 once this object is constructed.
 <p>
 This class uses a graph to describe the function dependency,
 where the nodes of the graph correspond to the ports and an edge
 indicates a function dependency. The edges go from input ports
 to output ports that depend on them.
 <p>
 The dependency graph by default indicates complete dependency,
 which means that each output port depends on all input ports.
 This default dependency graph is constructed in the protected
 method {@link #_constructDependencyGraph()}, which can be
 overridden in subclasses to construct a more accurate
 dependency graph. See {@link FunctionDependencyOfAtomicActor}
 and {@link FunctionDependencyOfCompositeActor} for example
 concrete subclasses. The composite actor version analyzes
 the contained model to determine from the function dependencies
 of the contained actors and from the connections what the
 function dependencies of the composite actor are.
